# Git CLI

## Overview
Git CLI is a command-line interface tool for managing Git repositories. Built with Python, it simplifies essential Git operations like initializing repos, creating and switching branches, committing changes, and syncing with remote repositories. This project aims to enhance version control efficiency for developers of all skill levels.

## Features
- **Set Working Directory**: Change the current working directory to any specified path.
- **Create New Repository**: Initialize a new Git repository in the current directory.
- **Branch Management**:
  - Create new branches
  - Show the list of available branches
  - Change to a specified branch
  - Delete existing branches
- **File Management**:
  - Show pending files and their statuses
  - Commit changes with a user-defined message
  - View commit history
- **Remote Repository Management**: Add and manage remote repositories.
- **Synchronization**:
  - Pull changes from the remote repository
  - Push changes to the remote repository

## Installation
